Basic Commands
--------------

To run you project you have to follow several steps:
1) Create a local venv and run pip3 install command for fetching project dependencies.
2) Fill in the .env file located in the main storage. For example see the .template.env
(IMPORTANT)
*
If you want to test the checkout system, you will need a Stripe account and 3 API keys
(publishable key, secret key and a secret key for tracking webhooks requests). Since
the Stripe webhooks deals with the secure (https) requests only, you will need something
like ngrock to forward requests from a temporary ngrock domain to the localhost.
Then you'll have to insert the temporary domain name into the ALLOWED_HOSTS in the
config/settings/local.py file.
*

3) Export DJANGO_READ_DOT_ENV_FILE=True environmental variable

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.
